## Hey everyone, version 2.1.3 is live now!

## Changes:

- Added an all new auto-role system! 
  - You can now add autoroles (roles that'll be added when a user joins your server) 
  - command: `c!autorole`  
  - Usage: `c!autorole add/remove @role/role id`

- New Custom Triggers! 
    - While this system may not be very advanced yet, it is pretty efficient in handling **exact** message triggers!
    - command: `c!trigger` 
    - Usage: `c!trigger add/remove <trigger> <response>`
 
- Ability to disable/enable commands!
    - Yes its true, you can now disable commands with a click of a finger!
    - command: `c!commands` 
    - Usage: `c!commands enable/disable command name/command alias`

### You can also use the above commands without any further arguments for more info on how the command is used! Example: `c!autorole` or `c!trigger` and so on...


## Patches:

- Fixed truth, dare and paranioa commands returning undefined! 

- Changed the sentences in the `fasttype` mini-game. It now returns random sentences instead of the bs I had input...

### Thats gonna be it for now, make sure to give suggestions on new commands in the #suggestions channel in our server [here](https://discord.com/invite/CAJWYQB)
