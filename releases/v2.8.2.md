## Update to v2.8.2 is now live! 

### Changes:

- Added a new Decancer command that converts zalgo text from usernames, nicknames or custom text to readable UTF-8 font. Type `c!decancer` to learn more.
- Triggers now work when the trigger is included in a message i.e. triggers when a trigger is included in the message content unlike the previous version where the message content had to be exactly the same as the trigger. Type `c!trigger` for more info.

### Patches:
- Fixed the random stuff that popped up while interacting with buttons 
- Poll command - Emojis other than the choices of the poll won't be displayed in the graph anymore
- Other minor bugs

### Additional:

- Citron's landing page is finally out! Check it out here - https://www.citronbot.live
- This might just be the bot's last update as I have to shift my focus to high school for sometime. I will try my best to keep the work going in whatever free time I can get... You can still get help with the bot in our discord server [here](https://discord.gg/KuWNY5TQPD). Suggestions are welcome in [#suggestions](https://discord.gg/A4E2WU5HfX)
