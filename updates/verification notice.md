YOOOO WE DID IT!
1,000 GUILDS!!! :heart:

I honestly didn't expect citron to blow up but here we are. To everyone who supported me through my journey and encouraged me at every step, thanks a lot all of you, you're the best! 

Special mention to @Legendary#9585 for suggesting the name "citron" kekw

It's been a beautiful journey, I just can't thank you enough for being a part of it, I love y'all :heart:

Also, anyone affected by the war, stay safe, I don't wanna support any side I just hope this crisis ends soon
